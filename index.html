                My name is Dylan Lisk. I'm a recent graduate of Flatiron School Data Science Immersive program. 
                The course was rigorous and gave me a good baseline understanding of machine learning.
                When it comes to models I tend to favor simple solutions like log-reg or a flavor linear regression.

                The purpose of this website is two fold. <strong>The first</strong> being to broaden my programming skills to include web developement.
                <strong>The second</strong> is to show off my previous projects and share current projects while also allowing others to interface with them.
